This is a real-time emotion detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). To get started, download the zipfile and the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer. Next, run the model file. Training the model may be time-consuming, but you can speed it up by removing some emotionsâ€”consider keeping only 3, as I did. Once you run the main file, your app will be ready. If desired, you can convert it into a web app. Thank you.
